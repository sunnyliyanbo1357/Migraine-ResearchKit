Using ResearchKit to gether data for migraine research

### About Migraine 
Migraines are painful headaches often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light. Migraine symptoms include a pounding headache, nausea, vomiting, and light sensitivity, and can be treated with antinausea drugs and abortive or preventive medications.
As we look up some researches in Migraine Research Foundation Common Migraine, migraine can only be relieved but cannot be cured. The common migraine triggers are stress, lack of sleep, food addictive, highly caffeinated beverages,  alcohol, bright lights and loud sounds, changes in weather, physical activity, therefore these triggers will be main factors and data sources for us to implement in researchkit.
